Commands we will be using:

         RMDIR - Delete a directory

         MKD - Make a new directory

         FTP - Connects to a remote FTP server

         BYE - Exit connection to FTP server

         CD - Change directory

         GET - Get a file from the server and transfer it to the local computer *A main command*

         MGET - Get multiple files

         PUT - Put files to the remote server

         MPUT - Put multiple files

         LS - Lists files from server *A main command*

         PWD - Print working directory *Use whenever the user changes directory to keep track in the GUI*
         
         CDUP - Go up a directory

Notes:

          We will need to use both ASCII and Binary protocols, ASCII for ASCII files and Binary for all others.
          
          Since we are doing a GUI, the classes (and therefore the work) will be broken up into five parts.
          Part 1: GUI
          Part 2: Connection (Ports, IP, just establish the connection and let the other classes pull from it.)
          Part 3: Upload (Only handles uploading.)
          Part 4: Download (Only handles downloading.)
          Part 5: Other Commands (A cross-team class, we can implement this after completing the others.)
